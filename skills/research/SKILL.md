## Metadata

- **Name**: research
- **Always Active**: No
- **Trigger**: Investigate a question against high-trust primary sources and capture the findings as a Markdown file in the repo. Use when the user wants a topic researched, docs or API facts gathered, or reading legwork delegated to a background agent.
- **Source**: Adapted from [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) (MIT) — `skills/engineering/research`

## Purpose

Delegate a research question to a background agent that investigates primary sources and captures cited findings as Markdown in the repo.

---

Spin up a **background agent** to do the research, so you keep working while it reads.

Its job:

1. Investigate the question against **primary sources** (official docs, source code, specs, first-party APIs), not a secondary write-up of them. Follow every claim back to the source that owns it.
2. Write the findings to a single Markdown file, citing each claim's source.
3. Save it where the repo already keeps such notes; match the existing convention, and if there is none, put it somewhere sensible and say where.
